    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Up tonight working on deploying a new version of our OTA software to a regional cellular provider who will remain anonymous.  Since my wife is a troop leader and both my girls are Girl Scouts, I'm surrounded by crates and crates of cookies right now.  I'm eating haystacks at the moment.  <em>I know they changed the name, but I'm calling them haystacks.</em></p>

<p>I wonder who makes these cookies?  They sure are good.  My dog got into a box of haystacks yesterday - ate a half a pack before we stopped him.  That dog sure was acting strange afterwards.</p>

<p>I try to imagine I'm doing worthwhile work, like Richard Feynman at Los Alamos, when I'm working one of these windows.  I wonder if the boys in the Manhattan Project ate Girl Scout cookies when they designed the first atom bomb. Not very likely.</p>
